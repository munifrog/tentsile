    <string name="faq_activity_title">Frequently Asked Questions</string>
    <string name="faq_activity_description">Tap on the questions you want answered</string>
    <string name="faq_accuracy_question">How accurately do I need to measure?</string>
    <string name="faq_accuracy_answer">The App itself is accurate to one imperial foot. You can use
        the app to get the measurement sufficiently close to then be able to align the tent
        according to the manufacturers instructions.</string>
    <string name="faq_all_at_once_question">What if my measurement goes off the screen?</string>
    <string name="faq_all_at_once_answer">If the tether intersection point is visible, you can drag
        it to move all the anchors simultaneously. You can also change the units using the
        measurement scale feature.</string>
    <string name="faq_measurement_1_question">Do I need to know how thick the tree is?</string>
    <string name="faq_measurement_1_answer">You do not need to know where the center of the tree is.
        Instead, imagine a knot on the surface of each tree about where the tent tether would attach,
        and measure the distance from the imaginary knot on one tree to the imaginary knot on the
        next anchoring tree, etc.</string>
    <string name="faq_measurement_2_question">What am I measuring?</string>
    <string name="faq_measurement_2_answer">You are measuring the distances between (approximate
        locations of the) knots.</string>
    <string name="faq_missing_platform_question">Why is my tent not in the list?</string>
    <string name="faq_missing_platform_answer">Try dragging the list with your finger to view tents
        that are not in view. Otherwise, if it is a newer product, we may need to add it. In that
        case try using a tent or hammock with a similar \"footprint\" as yours.</string>
    <string name="faq_tools_question">What tools will I need?</string>
    <string name="faq_tools_answer">It helps to have a measuring tool handy, such as measuring tape
        or laser measuring tool. But, you could perform the measurements using consistently-spaced
        units, such as equally-spaced knots in a string, sufficiently consistent paces, or even the
        straps that come with the tent. The point here is to measure using consistent units.</string>
    <string name="faq_symbol_orange_triangle_question">What does the orange triangle indicate?</string>
    <string name="faq_symbol_orange_triangle_answer">The orange triangle indicates that setup is
        possible, but involves a non-intuitive \"trick\". After wrapping the strap around the tree,
        (as you usually do), pass the ratchet (rather than the loose end of the strap) through the
        strap loop, and then use the ratchet to tighten the strap.</string>
    <string name="faq_symbol_yellow_triangle_question">What does the yellow triangle indicate?</string>
    <string name="faq_symbol_yellow_triangle_answer">The yellow triangle indicates that you will
        probably not have sufficient strap length to wrap around the tree according to the manufacturers
        recommendations. Setup requires a strap extension.</string>
    <string name="faq_symbol_red_x_question">What does the red X indicate?</string>
    <string name="faq_symbol_red_x_answer">The red X indicates that (ideal) setup is not possible.
        The tree with the red X over it is too close.</string>
