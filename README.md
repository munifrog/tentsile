# Introduction

Designed to assist in the setup of three-way tents and hammocks.
These camping structures typically hang from three trees that are strong enough to handle the forces involved.

# Using this App In the Real World - Word of Caution

Please follow the recommendations of the manufaturers.

For instance, it is recommended that these camping structures remain close to the ground,
although not so close that when you get in the tent it touches the ground.
When you see images of these tents and hammocks much higher than this,
please note that they were setup by professionals and experts.

Please exercise caution while setting up yours.

# Turn-around On Fixes

I am writing this application in my free time.
As such, I cannot guarantee I will have the time, whenever a defect is discovered, to fix the issue quickly.

# Manufacturers

Tentsile, a pun on the mechanical engineering term for stretch (i.e., tensile) forces, is a leading manufacturer of hanging tents and three-way hammocks.
There are other brands available, but this release specifically mentions the models produced by Tentsile.
This is in large part due to my desire to assist their customers, myself being one of them.

Please note that the Tentsile tents and hammocks, although specifically named in this application, are trademarked.
In communicating with the Tentsile teams, I asked about adding the (TM) symbol and received no specific direction, one way or another so I opted for leaving it out.

The math is simplified by Tentsile's consistent strap length (with Una being the exception).
But if other manufacturers are added later I may include the manufacturer as part of the tent or hammock name.

# Contributing

If you want to contribute, you can propose ideas and/or create a pull request.
Please note that ideas you propose will not be compensated.

I considered dividing this application into free and paid versions, (and this can be seen in the Android code),
but ultimately decided to provide it for free.
(Not everyone has internet access to make a payment or download while camping.)

I also don't need the money.
Volunteering time to maintain the code is what will help this project the most.
